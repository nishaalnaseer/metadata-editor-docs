# Documenting an image

"Although photographs may be more explicit than a long discourse for humans, they don’t describe themselves in term of content as texts do. For texts, authors use many clues to indicate what they are talking about: titles, abstract, keywords, etc. which may be used for automatic cataloguing. Searching for photos must rely on manual cataloguing, or relate texts and documents that come with the photos."

## Metadata standards

This chapter explains how to document digital images using the Metadata Editor. Digital images are electronic files typically stored in formats such as JPG, PNG, or TIFF. These may include photographs taken by digital cameras, computer-generated graphics, or scanned images. The Metadata Editor applies metadata standards to ensure that images are discoverable, accessible, and usable. To achieve this, metadata should cover:

- **Content information**: Caption, description, keywords, and other descriptive elements.
- **Provenance information**: Date, location, author, and source.
- **Rights and privacy considerations**: Copyright/license details and privacy-related information (e.g., presence of identifiable individuals, especially minors), enabling users to use images legally, ethically, and responsibly.


## Metadata embedded in digital image files

Some devices, such as digital cameras, automatically generate and embed metadata in image files. This metadata, known as EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format), records:
- **Date and time** the image was taken.
- **GPS coordinates** (latitude, longitude, and possibly altitude) if geolocation was enabled.
- **Device information**: Manufacturer, model, lens type, focal range, aperture, shutter speed, and flash settings.
- **Unique image identifier** generated by the system.

EXIF metadata can be extracted or viewed using various tools. For instance, R packages such as *ExifTool* and *ExifR* allow extraction and processing of EXIF metadata, while applications like Flickr display EXIF content. However, beyond date, location, and unique identifiers, EXIF metadata provides little information relevant to identifying an image’s source or content.


## Enhancing metadata with additional descriptive information

Since EXIF metadata lacks detailed content descriptions, curators must supplement it with additional information. Some of this metadata can be manually entered, while other elements can be automatically extracted using machine learning models or APIs. This information is structured and stored according to metadata standards supported by the Metadata Editor.

The Metadata Editor offers two mutually exclusive options for documenting images:
- **Dublin Core (DCMI)**: A simple and flexible metadata schema.
- **IPTC**: A more detailed and comprehensive schema, by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC).

Both options are supplemented with a few common metadata elements, including cataloging parameters and unique identifiers.


## IPTC and Dublin Core standards

### Dublin Core standard

The Dublin Core (DCMI) standard consists of 15 core metadata elements, which are supplemented in the Metadata Editor with additional elements, primarily from the ImageObject schema of schema.org. This option provides a simpler, flexible approach to documenting images.

### IPTC Standard

The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard (version 2019.1) is the most widely adopted standard for describing images, recognized by news agencies, photographers, libraries, museums, and other industries. It consists of two schemas:
- **IPTC Core**: Covers essential descriptive fields.
- **IPTC Extension**: Provides additional elements for greater detail.

IPTC metadata includes fields for time and geographic coverage, people and objects shown, usage rights, and more. Since the IPTC schema is highly detailed, curators will typically use only a subset of the available fields. Where applicable, the use of controlled vocabularies is recommended for consistency.


## Metadata structure and templates

The Metadata Editor uses a schema that contains:
- **Common metadata elements**: Used for cataloging, assigning unique identifiers, and documenting metadata provenance.
- **Two metadata blocks**: One for IPTC and one for Dublin Core. Users can choose one of these options to describe the image.
- **Additional elements**: Common to both options, providing supplementary documentation.

To facilitate image documentation, the Metadata Editor includes two pre-configured metadata templates: one based on Dublin Core, the other based on IPTC. These templates can be customized using the Template Manager to suit the organization’s needs.


## Documenting an image using the Dublin Core option

This section describes the documentation of an image using the Dublin Core (DCMI) option.

The Dublin Core standard contains 15 core elements, which are generic and versatile enough to be used for documenting different types of resources. Other elements can be added to the specification to increase its relevancy for specific uses. We added a few elements inspired by the [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject) schema from schema.org to the 15 elements.

The fifteen elements, with their definition extracted from the [Dublin Core website](https://dublincore.org/), are the following:

| Element name         | Description                                                      | 
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `identifier `        | An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. |
| `type`               | The nature or genre of the resource.                             |
| `title`              | A name given to the resource.                                    |
| `description`        | An account of the resource.                                      |
| `subject`            | The topic of the resource.                                       |
| `creator`            | An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.         |
| `contributor`        | An entity responsible for making contributions to the resource.  |
| `publisher`          | An entity responsible for making the resource available.         |
| `date`               | A point or period of time associated with an event in the life cycle of the resource. |
| `coverage`           | The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant.|
| `format`             | The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource. |
| `language`           | A language of the resource.                                      |
| `relation`           | A related resource.                                              |
| `rights`             | Information about rights held in and over the resource.          |
| `source`             | A related resource from which the described resource is derived. |

The Metadata Editor does not use the `identifier` element, as the unique identifier is provided by the common element `idno`. 

The World Bank schema includes the following additional elements that are not part of the core list of the DCMI: 
- `identifiers`
- `caption`
- `keywords`
- `topics`
- `country`
- `gps` (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- `note`

These elements are included in the default template for the DCMI option.

### Create a new project

Create a new project by clicking on `CREATE NEW PROJECT` in the *My projects* page, and select option *Image* as data type.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_dcmi_create_new_project_type_selection.png)

In the new *project home page*, select a DCMI template (one DCMI template is provided with the application).

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_dcmi_project_home_page.png)

Edit the thumbnail by selecting an image. It is highly recommended to select the image being documented as thumbnail. The thumbnail will be used in the Metadata Editor itself, and in a NADA catalog is the image is published in NADA. The system will save the thumbnail as a low-resoluton image.


### Fill out the *Information on metadata* section

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_dcmi_information_on_metadata.png)

In the list of metadata elements below, the *key* of each element in the metadata standard is provided between brackets next to the corresponding element's label in the template.


### Fill out the DCMI and additional sections (image description)

We provide here some description and recommendations for the key metadata elements in the DCMI template.

**IMAGE DESCRIPTION** 

- **`Resource type`** (*type*) The Dublin Core schema is flexible and versatile, and can be used to document different types of resources. This element is used to document the type of resource being documented. The DCMI provides a list of suggested categories, including "image" which is the relevant type to be entered here. Some users may want to be more specific in the description of the type of resource, for example distinguishing color from black & white images. This distinction should not be made in this element; another element can be used for such purpose (like tags and tag groups). 

- **`date`** (*date*) The date when the photo was taken / the image was created, preferably entered in ISO 8601 format.

- **`Title`** (*title*) The title of the photo. 

- **`Caption`** (*caption*) A caption for the photo. 

- **`Description`** (*description*) A brief description of the content depicted in the image. This element will typically provide more detailed information than the title or caption. Note that other elements can be used to provide a more specific and "itemized" description of an image; the element `keywords` for example can be used to list labels associated with an image (possibly generated in an automated manner using machine learning tools).

- **`Keywords`** (*keywords*) Words or phrases that describe salient aspects of an image content. Can be used for building keyword indexes and for classification and retrieval purposes. A controlled vocabulary can be employed. Keywords should be selected from a standard thesaurus, preferably an international, multilingual thesaurus.  
  - **`Keyword`** (*name*) Keyword (or phrase). Keywords summarize the content or subject matter of the image. 
  - **`Vocabulary`** (*vocabulary*) Controlled vocabulary from which the keyword is extracted, if any.  
  - **`URL`** (*uri*) The URI of the controlled vocabulary used, if any.  

- **`Topics`** (*topics*) The `topics` field indicates the broad substantive topic(s) that the image represents. A topic classification facilitates referencing and searches in electronic survey catalogs. Topics should be selected from a standard controlled vocabulary such as the [Council of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) thesaurus](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/vocabulary/TopicClassification).
  - **`ID`** (*id*) The unique identifier of the topic. It can be a sequential number, or the ID of the topic in a controlled vocabulary.
  - **`Topic`** (*name*) The label of the topic associated with the data.  
  - **`Parent ID`** (*parent_id*) When a hierarchical (nested) controlled vocabulary is used, the `parent_id` field can be used to indicate a higher-level topic to which this topic belongs.
  - **`Vocabulary`** (*vocabulary*) The name of the controlled vocabulary used, if any. 
  - **`URL`** (*uri*) A link to the controlled vocabulary mentioned in field `vocabulary'.  

- **`country`** (*country*) The country shown in the image, if applicable. This information is highly relevant and will often be used as a filter (facet) in data catalogs. It is thus a "Recommended" field. An image will only represent part of a country, but we still want to capture this information in the metadata. Note that many organizations have their own policies on the naming and spelling of countries/regions/economies/territories, which data curators will have to comply with. In rare instances, the image may cover more than one country. The element is repeatable; multiple countries can be entered.
  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name of the country/economy where the photo was taken.
  - **`Code`** (*code*) The code of the country/economy mentioned in `name`. This will preferably be the ISO country code.  

- **`Geographic coverage`** (*coverage*) In the Dublin Core, the coverage can be either temporal or geographic. In the use of the schema, `coverage` is used to document the geographic coverage of the image. This element complements the `country` element, and allows more specific information to be provided.

- **`GPS position`** The geographic location where the photo was taken. Some digital cameras equipped with GPS can, when the option is activated, capture and store in the EXIF metadata the exact geographic location where the photo was taken. 
  - **`GPS latitude`** (*latitude*) The latitude of the geographic location where the photo was taken.
  - **`GPS longitude`** (*longitude*) The longitude of the geographic location where the photo was taken.
  - **`GPS altitude`** (*altitude*) The altitude of the geographic location where the photo was taken.  

- **`Format`** (*format*) This refers to the image file format. It is typically expressed using a MIME format.

- **`Languages`** (*languages*) The language(s) in which the image metadata (caption, title) is provided. This is a block of two elements (at least one must be provided for each language).
  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name of the language.
  - **`Code`** (*code*) The code of the language. The use of [ISO 639-2](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) (the alpha-3 code in Codes for the representation of names of languages) is recommended. Numeric codes must be entered as strings.   

- **`Source`** (*source*) A related resource from which the described image is derived.

- **`Relations`** (*relations*) A list of related resources (images or of other type)
  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name (title) of the related resource.
  - **`Type`** (*type*) A brief description of the type of relation. A controlled vocabulary could be used.
  - **`URL`** (*uri*) A link to the related resource being described.  

- **`Note`** (*note*) Any additional information on the image, not captured in one of the other metadata elements.

**AUTHORS AND RIGHTS**

- **`Creator`** (*creator*) The name of the person (or organization) who has taken the photo or created the image.

- **`Contributor`** (*contributor*) The contributor could be a person or organization, possibly a sponsoring organizations.

- **`Publisher`** (*publisher*) The person or organization who publish the image.

- **`Rights`** (*rights*) The copyrights for the photograph. License is in another (common) element.

> This completes the Dublin Core set of metadata elements. When this information is complete, continue with the other sections (sections common to both the Dublin Core and the IPTC options).

  
## Documenting an image using the IPTC option

This section describes the documentation of an image using the IPTC option.


### Create a new project

Create a new project by clicking on `CREATE NEW PROJECT` in the *My projects* page, and select option *Image* as data type.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_dcmi_create_new_project_type_selection.png)

In the new *project home page*, select an IPTC template (one IPTC template is provided with the application).

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_iptc_project_home_page.png)

Edit the thumbnail by selecting an image. It is highly recommended to select the image being documented as thumbnail. The thumbnail will be used in the Metadata Editor itself, and in a NADA catalog is the image is published in NADA. The system will save the thumbnail as a low-resoluton image.


### Fill out the *Information on metadata* section

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_image_iptc_information_on_metadata.png)


### Fill out the IPTC metadata and additional sections (image description)

We provide here some description and recommendations for the key metadata elements in the default IPTC metadata template provided in the Metadata Editor. The labels provided between parenthesis are the element names in the IPTC standard. The grouping of elements by section is the one in the template, not in the standard.

**TITLE STATEMENT**
                   
- **`Title`** (*tite*) The title is a shorthand reference for the digital image. It provides a short verbal and human readable name which can be a text and/or a numeric reference. It is not the same as the Headline (see below). Some may use the `title` field to store the file name of the image, though the field may be used in many ways. This element should not be used to provide the unique identifier of the image.

- **`Headline`** (*headline*) A brief publishable summary of the contents of the image. Note that a headline is not the same as a title.

- **`Globally unique identifier`** (*digitalImageGuid*) A globally unique identifier for the image. This identifier is created and applied by the creator of the digital image at the time of its creation. This value shall not be changed after that time. The identifier can be generated using an algorithm that would guarantee that the created identifier is globally unique. Device that create digital images like digital or video cameras or scanners usually create such an identifier at the time of the creation of the digital data, and add it to the metadata embedded in the image file (e.g., the EXIF metadata).IPTC’s requirements for unique ids are as follows:
  - It must be globally unique. Algorithms for this purpose exist.
  - It should identify the camera body.
  - It should identify each individual photo from this camera body.
  - It should identify the date and time of the creation of the picture.
  - It should be secured against tampering.

- **`Date created`** (*dateCreated*) Designates the date and optionally the time the content of the image was created. For a photo, this will be the date and time the photo was taken. When no information is available on the time, the time is set to 00:00:00. The preferred format for the `dateCreated` element is the truncated DateTime format, for example: 2021-02-22T21:24:06Z


**AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS**

- **`Creator name`** (*creatorNames*) Enter details about the creator or creators of this image. The Image Creator must often be attributed in association with any use of the image. The Image Creator, Copyright Owner, Image Supplier and Licensor may be the same or different entities.       

- **`Creator job title`** (*jobtitle*) The job title of the photographer (the person listed in `creatorNames`). The use of this element implies that the photographer information (`creatorNames` is not empty). 

- **`Job ID`** (*jobid*) Number or identifier for the purpose of improved workflow handling (control or tracking). This is a user created identifier related to the job for which the image is supplied. 
  Note: As this identifier references a job of the receiver’s workflow it must first be issued by the receiver, then transmitted to the creator or provider of the news object and finally added by the creator to this field. 

- **`Source`** (*Source*) The name of a person or party who has a role in the content supply chain. The `source` can be different from the `creator` and from the entities listed in the Copyright Notice. 

- **`Supplier`** (*supplier*) The supplier of the image (person or organization)
  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name of the supplier of the image (person or organization). 
  - **`Identifier`** (*identifiers*) The identifier for the most recent supplier of this image. This will not necessarily be the creator or the owner of the image.  

- **`Supplier ID** (*imageSupplierImageId*) A unique identifier assigned by the image supplier to the image.
  
- **`Credit`** (*creditLine*) The credit to person(s) and/or organization(s) required by the supplier of the image to be used when published. This is a free-text field.

- **`Caption writer`** (*captionWriter*) An identifier, or the name, of the person involved in writing, editing or correcting the description of the image. 

- **`Contact`** (*creatorContactInfo*) The creator’s contact information provides all necessary information to get in contact with the creator of this image and comprises a set of elements for proper addressing. Note that if the creator is also the licensor, his or her contact information should be provided in the `licensor` fields.  
  - **`Country`** (*country*) The country name for the address of the person that created this image. 
  - **`Email (work)`** (*emailwork*) The work email address(es) for the creator of the image. Multiple email addresses can be given, in which case they should be separated by a comma. 
  - **`Region (State/Province)`** (*region*) The state or province for the address of the creator of the image. 
  - **`Phone (work)`** (*phonework*) The work phone number(s) for the creator of the image. Use the international format including the country code, such as +1 (123) 456789. Multiple numbers can be given, in which case they should be separated by a comma. 
  - **`URL`** (*weburlwork*) The work web address for the creator of the image. Multiple addresses can be given, in which case they should be separated by a comma. 
  - **`Address`** (*address*) The address of the creator of the image. This may comprise a company name. 
  - **`City`** (*city*) The city for the address of the person that created the image. 
  - **`Postal code`** (*postalCode*) Enter the local postal code for the address of the person who created the image.


**CONTENT DESCRIPTION**
    
- **`Description`** (*description*) A textual description, including captions, of the image. This describes the who, what, and why of what is happening in this image. This might include names of people, and/or their role in the action that is taking place within the image. Example: "The president of the Metadata Association delivers the keynote address".

- **`Scene codes`** (*sceneCodes*) The `sceneCodes` describe the scene of a photo content. The [IPTC Scene-NewsCodes](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene) controlled vocabulary (published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license) should be used, where a scene is represented as a string of 6 digits.

- **`Scene codes labelled`** (*SceneCodesLabelled*) The `Scene codes` element described above only allows for the capture of codes. To improve discoverability (by indexing important keywords), not only the scene codes but also the scene description should be provided. The IPTC standard does not provide an element that allows the scene label and description to be entered. The `Scene codes labelled` is an element that we added to our schema. Ideally, curators will enter the scene codes in the element `Scene codes` to maintain full compatibility with the IPTC, and complement that information by also entering the codes and their description in the `Scene codes labelled` element. 
  - **`Code`** (*code*) The code for the scene of a photo content. The [IPTC Scene-NewsCodes](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene) controlled vocabulary (published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license) should be used, where a scene is represented as a string of 6 digits. See table above. 
  - **`Label`** (*label*) The label of the scene. See table above for examples. 
  - **`Description`** (*description*) A more detailed description of the scene. See table above for examples.  

- **`Subject codes`** (*subjectCodes*) Specifies one or more subjects from the [IPTC Subject-NewsCodes](http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/subjectcode) controlled vocabulary to categorize the image. Each Subject is represented as a string of 8 digits. The vocabulary consists of about 1400 terms organized into 3 levels (users can decide to use only the first, or the first two levels; the more detail is provided, the better the discoverability of the image). The first level of the controlled vocabulary is as follows:
      
  | code   | Label             | Description                       |
  |:------:|:-----------------:|-----------------------------------|

- **`Subject codes labelled`** (*subjectCodesLabelled*) The `Subject codes` element described above only allows for the capture of codes. To improve discoverability (by indexing important keywords), not only the subject codes but also the subject description should be provided. The IPTC standard does not provide an element that allows the subject label and description to be entered. The `subjectCodesLabelled` is an element that we added to our schema.

External resources that have already been created for another project can also be imported. To do that, they must first be exported as JSON or RDF from the other project. The click on `IMPORT` in the External resources page, and select the file. 

External resources will be part of the project ZIP package (when the ZIP package is generated - See the main menu).

### Add information on provenance

This section is common to both the DCMI and IPTC options.

The **Provenance** container is used to document how, frow where, and when the image was acquired. It is used to ensure traceability. See section *Documenting data - General instructions* for more information.

## Augmenting image metadata using AI

To make images discoverable, metadata that describe the content depicted in an image, the source of the image and the rights and licensing associated with it, are essential but not provided in the EXIF. Additional metadata must be provided. 

Some of these metadata will have to be generated by image authors and/or curators, other can be generated in a much automated manner using machine learning models and tools. Image processing algorithms that make it possible to augmented metadata include algorithms of face detection, person identification, automated labeling, text extraction, and others. Before describing the proposed metadata schema in the following sections, we present here some example of tools that make such metadata enhancement easy and affordable. 

The example we provide below makes use of the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop) to generate image metadata. Google Vision is one out of multiple tools that can be used for that purpose such as [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), or [Microsoft Azure Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/). This example makes use of a photo selected from the [World Bank Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/1543136297/in/album-72157634086023459/).

The image comes with a brief description that identifies the photographer, the location (name of the country and town, not GPS location), and the content of the image. The description of the image includes important keywords that, when indexed in a catalog, will support discoverability of the image. This information, to be manually entered, is valuable and must be part of the curated image metadata.

But we can add useful additional information in an automated manner and at low cost using machine learning models. In the example below, we use the (free) on-line ["Try it" tool](https://cloud.google.com/vision) of the Google Vision application.

The Google Vision API returns and displays the results of the image processing in multiple tabs. The same content is available programmatically in JSON format. The content of this JSON file can be mapped to elements of the metadata schema, for automatic addition to the image metadata.

The first tab is the result of **faces** detection. Each detected face has a bounding box and metadata such as the derived emotion of the person. The bounding box can be used to automatically flag images that have one or multiple "significant size" face(s) and may have to be excluded from the published images for privacy protection reasons.

The second tab reports on detected **objects**.

The third tab suggests **labels** that could be attached to the image, provided with a degree of confidence. A threshold can be set to automatically add (or not) each proposed label as a keyword in the image metadata.

The fourth tab shows the **text** detected in the image. The quality of text detection and recognition depends on the resolution of the image and on the size and orientation of the text in the image. In our example, the algorithm fails to read (most of) the small, rotated and truncated text. 

![image](img/ME_UG_documenting_image_google_vision_08.png)

The tool managed to recognize some, but not all characters. In this case, this would be considered as not useful information to be added to the image metadata.

We are not interested in the **properties** tab which does not provide information that can be used for discoverability of images based on their content or source.

The last tab, **Safe search**, could be used as warnings if you plan to make the image publicly accessible.

This "Try it" tool demonstrates the capabilities of the application which, for automating the processing of a collection of images, would be accessed programmatically using R, Python or another programming language. Accessing the application's API requires a key. The cost of image labeling, face detection, and other image processing is low. For information on pricing, consult the website of the API providers.
