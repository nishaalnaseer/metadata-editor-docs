# Acknowledgments

The Metadata Editor application was developed by Mehmood Asghar (Senior Data Engineer, World Bank, lead developer) with Olivier Dupriez (Deputy Chief Statistician, World Bank, project manager). The User Guide was written by Olivier Dupriez and Mehmood Asghar.

The application was in part inspired by the Nesstar Publisher software application (by the Norwegian Social Science Data Archive). 

The application benefited from feedback from many colleagues who reviewed and tested it.
