# Documenting research projects and scripts

## Rationale

Documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data** has the potential to increase the volume and diversity of data analysis. There is also much value in documenting, cataloguing and disseminating **data processing and analysis scripts**. Technological solutions such as GitHub, [Jupyter Notebooks or Jupiter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) facilitate the preservation and sharing of code, and enable collaborative work around data analysis. Coding style guides like the [Google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) and the [Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf) by the British Ecological Society, contribute to foster the usability, adaptability, and reproducibility of code. But these tools and guidelines do not fully address the issue of cataloguing and discoverability of the data processing and analysis programs and scripts. We propose --as a complement to collaboration tools and style guides-- a metadata schema to document data analysis projects and scripts. The production of structured metadata will contribute not only to discoverability, but also to the reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics. 

There are multiple reasons to make reproducibility, replicability, and auditability of data analytics a component of a data dissemination system. This will:  

-	Improve the **quality of research and analysis**. Public scrutiny enables contestability and independent quality control of the output of research and analysis; these are strong incentives for additional rigor in data analysis. 
-	Allow the **re-purposing or expansion of analysis** by the research community, thereby increasing the relevance, utility and value of both the data and of the analytical work. 
-	Strengthen the **reputation and credibility** of the analysis. 
-	Provide students and peers with rich **training materials**.  
-	In some cases, satisfy a **requirement** imposed by peer reviewed journals or financial sponsors of research activities. For example, the [Data and Policy Code of the American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) (accessed on June 29, 2020), states that *It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented, and access to the data and code is clearly and precisely documented and is non-exclusive to the authors. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.* 
-	Contribute to **assuring the fairness of policy advice and interventions** resulting from data analysis. Data analysis may be used to identify or target the beneficiaries of policies and programs, or may contribute otherwise to the design and implementation of development policies and projects. By doing so, they also contribute to identifying populations to be excluded from these interventions. Errors and biases may be introduced in analysis by accidental or intentional human errors, by the algorithms themselves, or they can result from flaws in the data. The analysis that informs such projects and policies should therefore be made auditable and contestable, i.e. documented and published. 


## The metadata standard

To make data processing and analysis scripts more discoverable and usable, we propose a metadata schema inspired by the schemas available to document datasets. The proposed schema contains two main blocks of metadata elements: the *document description* intended to document the metadata themselves (the term *document* refers to the file that will contain the metadata), and the *project description* used to document the research or analytical work and the related scripts. We also include in the schema the `tags`, `provenance`, and `additional` elements common to all schemas.  


## Preparing for the documentation

Before you start documenting the project, it is highly recommended to organize all relevant resources in an optimal manner. This includes following best practice in the writing of scripts (and ideally adopting a relevant style guide), of naming the files containing your programs and scripts, or organizing a GitHub repository if you publish content on GitHib, and more.

Resources related to best practice in code writing and reproducibility include (among others):
- **World Bank Reproducible Research Catalog**: An online catalog of reproducible research by the World Bank, which makes use of the metadata standard documented in the chapter (https://reproducibility.worldbank.org/)
- **Reproducible Research**: A wiki page by the World Bank DIME department (https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Reproducible_Research)
- **World Bank Reproducible Research Repository Resources**: (https://worldbank.github.io/wb-reproducible-research-repository/)
- **PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code** (for Python users) (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- **Tidyverse style guide** by the tidyverse team (for R users) (https://style.tidyverse.org/)


## Documenting the research project

### Create a new project

The first step in documenting a research project and its scripts is to create a new project. You do that by clicking on `CREATE NEW PROJECT` in the *My projects* page. Select *Script* as data type. This will open a new, untitled *Project Home* page.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_script_create_new_project_type.png)

In that page, edit the thumbnail and replace it with an image of your choice (recommended, not required).

Then select (in the *Template* frame) the project template you want to use to document the project. A default template is proposed; no action is needed if you want to use the default template. Otherwise, switch to another template by clicking on the template name in the **Templates** frame. Note that you can at any time change the template used for the documentation of a project. The selected template will determine what you see in the navigation tree and in the metadata entry pages, but switching from one template to another will not impact the metadata that has already been entered; no information will be deleted from the metadata.

### Enter metadata


#### Metadata information

The Metadata information section in the navigation tree (in the Project page) contains elements intended to document the metadata being generated, i.e., metadata about the metadata. All content in this section is optional; it is however recommended practice to document the metadata as precisely as possible. This information will not be useful to data users, but it will be to catalog administrators. When metadata is shared across catalogs, the information entered in the `Information on metadata` provides transparency and clarity on the origin of the metadata.

#### Project description

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_documenting_script_project_description.png)

We provide below a description of the metadata elements contained in the `Project description` section of the default metadata template provided in the Metadata Editor. Other templates may show a different selection, different labels, or present the elements in a different sequence. When you document a dataset, it is not expected that all these elements will be filled. Fill all required elements, all recommended elements when content can be made available, and fill as many as the other elements (the required and recommended elements will be those marked as *required* or *recommended* in the metadata standard or template).

In the list of metadata elements below, the *key* of each element in the metadata standard is provided between brackets next to the corresponding element's label in the template.


**TITLE STATEMENT**

- **`Primary ID`** (*idno*) A unique identifier to the project. Define and use a consistent scheme to use. Avoid including spaces in the ID.  The ID number of a research project is a unique number that is used to identify a particular project. This ID number is a vital reference. A research project can be the formal cause of a survey, scripts, tables and knowledge products. Do not include spaces in the idno element. Use a system that guarantees uniqueness of the ID (DOI, own reference number).

- **`Other identifiers`** (*identifiers*) This repeatable element is used to enter identifiers (IDs) other than the `idno` entered in the `title_statement`. It can for example be a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Note that the identifier entered in `idno` can (and in some cases should) be repeated here. The element `idno` does not provide a `type` parameter; repeating it in this section makes it possible to add that information. 
  - **`Type`** (*type*) The type of unique ID, e.g. "DOI".
  - **`Identifier`** (*identifier*) The identifier itself. 
   
- **`Title`** (*title*) The title is the official name of the project as it may be stated in reports, papers or other documents. The title will in most cases be identical to the Document Title (see above). The title may correspond to the title of an academic paper, of a project impact evaluation, etc. Pay attention to capitalization in the title.
 
- **`Subtitle`** (*sub_title*) Subtitle is optional and rarely used. A short subtitle for the project. Often the sub title is used to qualify the title or rephrase the title.    

- **`Alternate title`** (*alternate_title*) An alternate title of the project. This would be any alternate title that would help discover the research project. In countries with more than one official language, a translation of the title may be provided. Likewise, the translated title may simply be a translation into English from a country's own language.  

- **`Translated title`** (*translated_title*) A translated version of the title (this will be used for example when a catalog documents all entries in English, but wants to preserve the title of a project in its original language when the original language is not English).

- **`Project website`** (*project_website*) URL of the project website.

- **`Abstract`** (*abstract*) The abstract should provide a clear summary of the purposes, objectives and content of the project. An abstract can make reference to the various outputs associated with the research project. 
  Example: "Food price inflation is an important metric to inform economic policy but traditional sources of consumer prices are often produced with delay during crises and only at an aggregate level. This may poorly reflect the actual price trends in rural or poverty-stricken areas, where large populations reside in fragile situations. This data set includes food price estimates and is intended to help gain insight in price developments beyond what can be formally measured by traditional methods. The estimates are generated using a machine-learning approach that imputes ongoing subnational price surveys, often with accuracy similar to direct measurement of prices. The data set provides new opportunities to investigate local price dynamics in areas where populations are sensitive to localized price shocks and where traditional data are not available.",

- **`Geographic areas`** (*geographic_units*) The geographic areas covered by the project. When the project relates to one or more countries, or part of one or more countries, it is important to provide the country name. This means that for a project related to a specific province or town of a country, the country name will be entered in addition to the province or town (as separate entries in this repeatable block of elements). Note that the area does not have to be an administrative area; it can for example be an ocean.
  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name of the geographic area.

  - **`Name`** (*name*) The name of the contact person that should be contacted depending on the role defined below. 
  - **`Role`** (*role*) Role of the contact person. A research project may have contact persons depending on the output or some of the technical input. Some complex projects may have various data collection processes that have different processing channels and contacts. This section should provide for a key primary public interface that can refer the public inquiry or provide a collection of entry points. 
  - **`Affiliation`** (*affiliation*) The organization or affiliation of the contact person. This is usually the organization that the contact person represents.

#### DataCite

See section **Documenting - General instructions**.


#### Tags

See section **Documenting - General instructions**.


#### Provenance 

The **Provenance** container is used to document how and when the project was acquired, if the project was extracted from an external catalog. It is used to ensure traceability. See section **Documenting - General instructions**.


#### External resources

External resources are all materials (and links) that relate to the indicator. This will include the programs and scripts, documents, and other digital resources and links. These materials and links are added in the External resources container. Select *External resources* in the navigation tree, then on `CREATE RESOURCE`. Enter the relevant information on the resource (at least a title), then provide either a filename (the file will then be uploaded on the server that hosts the Metadata Editor) or a URL to the resource.

External resources that have already been created for another project can also be imported. To do that, they must first be exported as JSON or RDF from the other project. Then click on `IMPORT` in the *External resources* page, and select the file.
