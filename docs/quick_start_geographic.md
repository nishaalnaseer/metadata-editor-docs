# Quick start: Geographic dataset

In this example, we will document a geographic dataset extracted from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) website. This dataset provides an outline of camps of Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The only file you need to reproduce this Quick-Start example is the image file *.../image/HDX_BGD_camps_thumbnail.jpg* (feel free to use any another PNG or JPG image file of your choice).

> This Quick Start section does not include detailed guidance on documenting geographic data. For comprehensive instructions, see the chapter **Documenting geographic datasets and services**.


## Step 1: Create a new project and add a thumbnail

To begin, open the Metadata Editor in your web browser (the URL is determined by where you installed the application), and log in with your username and password. The *My projects* page will be displayed, showing all projects you have previously created and those that have been shared with you by other data curators, if any. If you are using the application for the first time and no project has been shared with you, the project list will be empty.

Click on `CREATE NEW PROJECT` and select *Geospatial* when prompted to indicate the type of resource you will be documenting (in this case a geographic dataset).

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_document_create_project_types.png)
  
A new project page will open in a new tab.

You will use the JPG file *HDX_BGD_camps_thumbnail.jpg* as a thumbnail (or you may select another JPG or PNG image file of your choice). Note that providing a thumbnail is not required, but recommended. The thumbnail will be displayed in the Metadata Editor project list, and in the NADA catalog if the project is published in NADA. Click on the `edit` icon in the screenshot image, and select the image file when prompted.

Documenting a dataset consists of entering metadata in metadata entry forms defined by a metadata template. When you create a new project, a default template is automatically selected. We will use this template, so there is no need to switch template. The template we will use is named *Geospatial - Inspire/Gemini with additional elements* (version 1.0). It contains the metadata elements recommended by the INSPIRE directive of the European Union and the GEMINI specification from the United Kingdom, to which a few elements have been added.


## Step 2: Enter metadata

On the left navigation tree, select *Document description* to enter optional elements used to capture information on who documented the dataset and when. Enter your `name` as netadata producer, and the `date` of the day in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). This is the date when the metadata, not the dataset, was produced. Then click on `SAVE`.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_metadata_information_save.png)

You can now start entering the metadata related to the geographic dataset itself. In the navigation tree, first select *Description / Metadata* and enter the required information on the type of resource ("Dataset") in the field `Hierarchy level` and the required `Primary ID` (a unique identifier of your choice, e.g., JD_GEO_001; if you want to publish the document in a NADA catalog, make sure that this same identifier is not used by another user or for another project). 

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_identifiers.png)

Then proceed with the other sections in the navigation tree and fill out the following elements using the information provided in the HDX website, also provided below (see *Additional information* section in web page https://data.humdata.org/dataset/outline-of-camps-sites-of-rohingya-refugees-in-cox-s-bazar-bangladesh). The metadata template is a bit complex, due to the complexity of the underlying ISO 19139 metadata standard.

- ***Metadata language:*** English

After entering all available information, click on `SAVE`. Click on *Preview* in the navigation tree to view all information you have entered so far.


## Step 3: Add external resources

You can now finalize the documentation of the dataset by documenting and attaching *external resources*. External resources include all materials (files or links) you want to make accessible to users when you publish the dataset in a catalog. In this example, we will only add one resource: a link to the HDX website. 

To create an external resource, select *External resources* in the navigation tree and then click on `Create resource`. Most elements available to describe an external resource are optional, but at a minimum, you should enter the `Resource type` ("Web Site" in this case), the `Title` *(HDX Data Platform)*, and the URL in the section *Resource attachment*. *(https://data.humdata.org/dataset/outline-of-camps-sites-of-rohingya-refugees-in-cox-s-bazar-bangladesh)*. Then click `SAVE`. You will now have the external resource listed.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_external_resource_hdx.png)

With this, you have completed the documentation of the dataset (note that in practice, you would generate more detailed metadata than what we did in this example). The *My Projects* page will show this new entry. You may at any time go back to it to edit or complete the metadata.


## Step 4: Export and publish metadata

In the *Project* page, a menu of options is available to you.

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_open_actions_menu.png)

![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_actions_menu.png)


- ***Export package (ZIP)***

  This option will allow you to generate a ZIP file containing all metadata and resources related to the project. This package can be shared with others, who can import it in their own Metadata Editor.


- ***Export JSON***

  Export metadata to JSON will generate a JSON file containing the metadata. The option is provided to include all elements or only the non-private ones. The JSON file will look like this:
  
  ![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_json_metadata.png)


- ***Export RDF/XML*** and ***Export RDF/XML***

  These options allow you to export the metadata related to external resources in JSON or XML format.


- ***PDF documentation***

  A PDF version of the metadata can be automatically created. Select PDF documentation then click on `GENERATE PDF`. When the PDF is generated, click on `DOWNLOAD PDF`. You will obtain a bookmarked PDF file with all entered metadata.

  ![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_pdf_metadata.png)


- ***Publish to NADA***

  If you have a NADA catalog and the credentials to publish content in it, you can also `Publish to NADA`. Select a configured NADA catalog, select the options as shown in the screenshot below, and click `PUBLISH`.

  ![image](img/ME_UG_v1-0-0_quick_start_geographic_publish_to_NADA.png)

  The dataset will now be listed and made discoverable in the NADA catalog.
